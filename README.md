## Overview

`lumisc.py` provides a python implementation of my R package `lumisc`. `lumisc` provides number of small functions and utilities that I find useful or use regularly, inspired by [Hmisc](https://github.com/harrelfe/Hmisc).

## Installation

Currently the only way to install this package is through GitHub.

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/luhann/lumisc.py
```

or if you use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```python
uv pip install git+https://github.com/luhann/lumisc.py
```


Alternatively, you can also clone this git repo and run "pip install ." from the repo directory.

If you find a bug, please file a minimal reproducible example in the
[issues](https://github.com/luhann/lumisc.py/issues). I am grateful for any feedback and/or contributions.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions of all types\!

I am currently also using this package as a way to learn python package development so any help is greatly appreciated. I encourage typo corrections, bug reports, bug fixes and feature
requests.
